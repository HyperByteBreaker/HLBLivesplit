Run starts on first detected player movement after loading into the gameworld, so you can look around the map and set waypoints now!

splits occur on the following:
- prism collected
- boss killed
- final extract after all prisms and bosses completed
- cycle/abyss king screen




tested on windows 11 with HLB Version 0.5.1c.108329

offsets might change from system to system so ymmv!

!!! some of the variables the script uses are only initialized once you enter into the hubworld, only load the autosplitter AFTER the game is up and running !!!
